## What is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a multi-layer, artificially modeled network of neurons/nodes.

Useful for:
-   recognizing patterns in provided data sets
-   modeling non-linear and complex relationships

## Use Cases of Deep Learning

-   Facial recognition
-   Object detection and segmentation
-   Image and video generation
-   Self-driving cars
-   Text generation
-   NLP
-   ...and more!

## Overall Process

1.  Loading Data (Validation, Testing, Training)
2.  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3.  Create A Model and Network
4.  Begin Training
	-  Hyperparameters (LR, Layers, Batch Size)
5.  Optimizers
6.  Metrics: Loss per Epoch
7. Test Model
8.  Readjust and Re-evaluate
9.  Interpret Results
10.  Conclude ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
